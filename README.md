#hui

hui is an under development web framework. Its aim is to add and augment existing Bootstrap 3 CSS, Components and Javascript. It uses SASS in place of Bootstrap's regular LESS.

## Download hui

Clone this repository into your projects web-root directory. It's still under heavy development so its not recommended for production usage.    
    
   $ git clone https://github.com/johnny13/hui.git /your/webroot

## Build Environment
This step will allow you to quickly theme and alter hui to your preferences. It requires Node.js, GruntJS, Ruby and SASS. Once all of those libraries are available globablly on your system you should be able to add the remaining Node packages via Node.js Package Manager (npm).   
    
   $ cd hui    
   $ [ install node.js GruntJS and SASS ]    
   $ npm install   
   
   
#### Ruby & Sass
This project requeires Ruby and SASS to be installed. If you are on Linux or Mac you probably have ruby installed and all you have to do is run this command.
  
   $ gem install sass    
  
Otherwise you will also need to install Ruby.
