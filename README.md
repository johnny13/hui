Stylish Documentations
-------------------------

HUI can be worked into your project in a few different ways. First, you will want to include the style sheet in your header. 

This can be the basic package, which helps ensure cross browser computability via a serious of css resets, along with the basic framework for layout.

You can also optionally select a theme, which will provide some basic style elements, css buttons, and a number of other helpful additions. Full information can be found at huement.com/hui/themes

jQuery on Drugs
-------------------------

The next item you'll want to include is the javascript file, hui.js or hui-min.js. This can be placed in the header or footer, depending on your preferences.

This script will make a number of helpful ui additions to your standard jquery library. hui.js includes alot of helpful functions. shuffle, preload images, notefy command, color change animations, modal window, tool tips, and the jquery easing library. Along with other things. Full information can be found at huement.com/hui/code

Turn on, Tune in, Drop out
-------------------------

"Turn on" meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. "Tune in" meant interact harmoniously with the world around you - externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. "Drop out" suggested an active, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. "Drop Out" meant self-reliance, a discovery of one's singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean "Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity".
