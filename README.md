#### Area 2| CSS Theme and Widgets    

Items like Typography, Colors, Modal Windows, and the likes.    

#### Area 3| Javascript Library    

All the required code to make everything sing.

## Install HUI

For a totally custom build, load a full theme. Along with the basic CSS style elements, tap into all default widgets and displays.

     css_themes/dark/theme-min.css
