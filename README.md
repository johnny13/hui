#hui

hui is an under development web framework. Its aim is to add and augment existing Bootstrap 3 CSS, Components and Javascript. It uses SASS in place of Bootstrap's regular LESS.

## Download hui

Clone this repository into your projects web-root directory. It's still under heavy development so its not recommended for production usage.    
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/johnny13/hui.git /your/webroot

#### Optionally Setup the Plugins (optional but recommended)
This step will allow you to quickly theme and alter hui to your preferences. It requires Node.js, GruntJS and SASS. Once all of those libraries are available globablly on your system you should be able to add the remaining Node packages via Node.js Package Manager (npm).   
    
   $ cd hui
   $ [ install node.js GruntJS and SASS ]
   $ npm install
