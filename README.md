Huement User Interface [ HUI ]
---------------------------------------------

HUI is the fast, flexible and dynamic User Interface. Based on jQuery it provides a web template and ui framework.

Users First. Design Second.
---------------------

Huement User Interface [HUI] can adapt to almost all viewport sizes, and has multiple fallbacks for various end user systems. It also supports a standard touch interface from the get go, and can be easily integrated into any project, online or offline, anywhere supporting javascript and css.

Stylish Documentations
-------------------------

HUI can be worked into your project in a few different ways. First, you will want to include the style sheet in your header. 

This can be the basic package, which helps ensure cross browser computability via a serious of css resets, along with the basic framework for layout.

You can also optionally select a theme, which will provide some basic style elements, css buttons, and a number of other helpful additions. Full information can be found at huement.com/hui/themes

jQuery on Drugs
-------------------------

The next item you'll want to include is the javascript file, hui.js or hui-min.js. This can be placed in the header or footer, depending on your preferences.

This script will make a number of helpful ui additions to your standard jquery library. hui.js includes alot of helpful functions. shuffle, preload images, notefy command, color change animations, modal window, tool tips, and the jquery easing library. Along with other things. Full information can be found at huement.com/hui/code

Turn on, Tune in, Drop out
-------------------------

Those two files should give you a fully working framework, capable of getting your app quickly up and off the ground. Examples, and more information can be found at huement.com/hui

"Turn on" meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. "Tune in" meant interact harmoniously with the world around you - externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. "Drop out" suggested an active, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. "Drop Out" meant self-reliance, a discovery of one's singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean "Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity".
