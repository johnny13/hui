<p class='m10 p10'>
	The included css framework makes templating and setting up your html documents crazy easy. There are "hot" swappable themes, support for an HD styled jQuery UI and much more. Below are some sample layouts generated with just a few lines of standard html.<br/><br/>
	Also included is a CSS Reset File, based on the Yahoo YUI Standard reset file. This first and basic step really helps to ensure your site will look the same on all browsers. It saves alot of headaches down the road.
