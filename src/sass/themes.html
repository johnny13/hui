	<h1>hui themes overview</h1>
	<p>if you are not familiar with <code>.sass</code> or <code>.scss</code> files, you should read up on that real quick. its super easy to get the hang of, and will allow you to build dynamic style sheets really fast.<br/><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">http://sass-lang.com/</a></p>
	
	<p>Each of hui's themes are based on a <code>.scss</code> file. This allows you to easily customize the colors of any theme, with out needing to edit much of the css at all. A Node.js module for Sass is included in the hui repository. Otherwise you could install it via ruby gems.</p>
	
	<p>To customize a theme, open any .scss file in your text editor and customize the values. then run your Sass program. If you have Node.js already installed, you can use the GruntJS Gruntfile thats already included by running <code>grunt --force</code> from the hui directory on your system.</p>
	
	<p>Alternatively if you have installed Sass on your system via Ruby Gems, you can run this command: <code>sass /hui_theme_path/dev-theme.scss /hui_theme_path/dev-theme.css</code></p>
